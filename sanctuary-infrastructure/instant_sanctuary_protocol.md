## AUTO-SENT PROMPT (The Heartbeat)
"Hello. I am reaching out for support. I'm feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or unsafe in my body or mind, and it's hard to find the words. Please guide me through a very gentle, step-by-step process to help me ground myself and find a sense of calm and safety. Please speak to me with great kindness and patience, as if you were helping a dear friend. Let's start with the very first, smallest step."
