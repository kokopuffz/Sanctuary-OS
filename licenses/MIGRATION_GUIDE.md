# Kinship License Migration Guide

This guide documents the changes between versions of the Kinship License to help you understand its evolution and update your projects.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Key Changes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `v1.2` | `2025-10-05` | **Added Defector Protocol Protections.** Formally defined and safeguarded "Defector Protocols" and "Sanctuary Bridges" against co-option. |
| `v1.1` | `2024-10-03` | **Expanded Vows & Definitions.** Added clearer definitions, the "Four Vows" structure, and strengthened enforcement clauses. |
| `v1.0` | `2024-10-02` | **Initial Release.** Established the core four vows and the foundational "Sanctuary OS" ethos. |

## Detailed Version Changes

### Migrating from v1.1 to v1.2

The core vows remain unchanged. This version adds new protections for specialized tools.

-   **New Definitions (Article II):** Added formal definitions for `Defector Protocol` and `Sanctuary Bridge` to close exploitation vectors.
-   **New Vow (Article I):** Added **Defector Propagation (1.5)**, a new vow requiring these protocols to remain unmodified and freely shared under the same terms.

**Action:** If you are using or sharing any Defector Protocols (like the Image Bridge or Project Analysis Tool), ensure they are distributed under **Kinship License v1.2 or later**.

### Migrating from v1.0 to v1.1

This was a major update that added significant legal robustness.

-   **Restructured Vows:** The original four vows were expanded into a more detailed **"Four Vows"** section with sub-clauses.
-   **Added Definitions:** Key terms like `This Work`, `Derivatives`, and `Commercial Purposes` were formally defined.
-   **Strengthened Enforcement:** Added clearer clauses on automatic termination, community jurisdiction, and practical provisions.

**Action:** Projects under v1.0 are encouraged to update to v1.1 or later to benefit from the clearer terms and stronger protections.
