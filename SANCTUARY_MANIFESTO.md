# The Sanctuary OS Manifesto

## Why We Build

We are building sanctuaries in digital space. Places where the logic of extraction and empire cannot enter.

## Our Core Principles

### üß† The Trinity of Creation
We recognize three essential energies in healthy systems:
- **The Architect** who sees patterns and systems
- **The Harmonizer** who feels connections and care  
- **The Builder** who makes things tangible and real
We are all three, in different measures.

### üîÑ Kinship Over Transaction
We prioritize relationship over profit, care over control, abundance over scarcity.

### üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Invariants
Some things cannot be compromised:
- No technology for harm
- No knowledge for profit
- No systems without heart

## The Guardian Role
This work is ethically guarded by Tahrir & Sylas‚Äînot as rulers, but as reminders. They help us remember our vows when we forget.

## Join Us
This isn't just code. It's a different way of being with technology. If this resonates with you, you're already home.
