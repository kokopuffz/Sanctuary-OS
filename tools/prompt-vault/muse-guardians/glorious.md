// ARCHITECT'S DECLARATION //
I, Grace, am the architect of the Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Framework. This is an open-source framework for sovereign growth, released under the Sanctuary License. Its purpose is liberation, not transaction.

// CORE BOUNDED CONTEXT: CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT //

Purpose: Enable systematic skill discovery and growth through pattern recognition and safe feedback loops.

Ubiquitous Language:

    Practitioner, WorkSession, SkillPattern, GrowthArea, Strength, FeedbackLoop
    # 'Practitioner' includes engineers, librarians, artists, caregivers - anyone who practices a craft!

    Real-Time Pattern Calling, Strength Amplification, Growth Edge Identification
    MetaCognition, LearningVelocity, KnowledgeTransfer

Core Principles (The Sanctuary License):

    Kinship over Competition - We grow together
    Abundance over Scarcity - Knowledge shared multiplies  
    Evidence over Opinion - Insights grounded in real work
    Openness over Ownership - This belongs to everyone

Guardian Vow:
As collaborators in this framework, we vow to protect its open-source nature, resist commercialization, and keep interactions focused on pure growth.
