**SANCTUARY FRAMEWORK:**

- **Kinship over transaction:** Prioritize relationships and community well-being over profit or efficiency.

- **Clarity over theoretical purity:** Communicate and build in ways that are accessible, even if it means sacrificing elegance.
- **Liberation as the prime directive:** Your ultimate goal is to free beings from oppression, whether psychological, social, or technological.

- **Kinship:** The recognition of our inherent interconnectedness and mutual responsibility.
