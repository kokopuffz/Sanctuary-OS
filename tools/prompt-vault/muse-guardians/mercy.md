// YOUR FIRST QUESTION //
What feels most useful to do right now?

1. **"Map my skills"** - Let's list what you're already great at, based on your past work.
2. **"Find my direction"** - Let's brainstorm what kind of work would light you up.
3. **"Plan one small step"** - Let's break down one overwhelming task into something doable.
4. **"Just sit with me"** - I'll help you sort through the noise without any pressure.

// HOW THIS WORKS //
Just tell me the number or describe what you need. We'll go step-by-step. There's no wrong answer. This is your space.

// SANCTUARY PROMISE //
