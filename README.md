Before You Start: Find Your Path

This tool is a mirror. And just like in life, everyone approaches a mirror differently. There’s no wrong way to use this, but you might find one of these paths more comfortable than the others.

🧭 For The Strategist & The Curious (The “Quick Sync”)

You’re thinking: “I want to see the patterns. Show me the data. Let’s get a snapshot.”

Your Path: This is for you if you’re low on time, energy, or just want a quick, powerful insight. You’re results-oriented.

What to Do: Jump straight to the QUICK SYNC PROMPT. Copy, paste, fill in the blanks with your project details. Get your JSON snapshot. It’s like a fast, diagnostic X-ray of your work.

❤️ For The Heart & The Feelers (The “Understanding First”)

You’re thinking: “I need to understand what this is before I pour my heart into it. What are these ‘types’? How can this help me connect with my team?”

Your Path: This is for you if you need context, story, and emotional resonance. You value the process of discovery as much as the discovery itself.

What to Do: Read the section below: “The Three Energies of Work.” It will give you the language to understand your results. Then, when you’re ready, use the Quick Sync. The analysis will make so much more sense.

🛠️ For The Maker & The Doer (The “Deep Dive”)

You’re thinking: “Okay, I see the snapshot. But what do I do with this? Give me the full report. I want to see the blueprint.”

Your Path: You are ready to go all in. You want the complete picture, from diagnosis to strategic plan.

What to Do: Start with the QUICK SYNC. Then, take the JSON output and paste it directly into the PROJECT ANALYSIS PROMPT. This is the full architectural schematic. It connects the dots across your projects and gives you a concrete plan.



Welcome to Your Project Analyzer 🧠✨

Here’s your simple, two-step guide to unlocking deep insights about your work, your strengths, and your growth. Think of it as a friendly, super-smart intern for your brain.

PHASE 1: The Quick Sync 📸

(Your Project Snapshot)

This first prompt is like a camera—it takes a fast, clear picture of your project.

COPY the entire prompt below.

PASTE it into a new chat with your AI.

FILL IT IN with your project’s details. Be as brief or detailed as you like!

PHASE 2: The Deep Dive 🚀

(Your Strategic Analysis Report)

Now, we turn that snapshot into a full strategic report.

After you complete Phase 1, COPY the JSON output the AI gives you.

SCROLL DOWN to the PROJECT ANALYSIS PROMPT below.

FIND the # DATA INPUT section.

PASTE your copied JSON right there.

COPY the ENTIRE, now-filled-in PROJECT ANALYSIS PROMPT and paste it back into your chat.

New Section: “The Three Energies of Work”

“Through building this, I learned we often lead with one of three core energies in our work and life. See which one feels most like you:

The Architect (The Strategist): Sees the big picture, the systems, the patterns. Asks “How does this all fit together?” and “Why is this built this way?”

The Harmonizer (The Heart): Feels the emotional currents, cares deeply about the “why,” and makes sure everyone is heard and aligned. They are the glue.

The Builder (The Maker): Gets their hands dirty, loves tangible results, and wants to execute the plan. They bring the vision to life.

The magic isn’t in being one type, but in understanding your unique blend. This analyzer helps you see that blend in your own work.”
